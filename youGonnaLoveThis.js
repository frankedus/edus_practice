//make a method that takes a number and return true, if the number is a palindrome
// feel free to use, the previous written python algorithm
// hint1: you can compare numbers as strings, by number convert to string => String(3)='3'







//console.log(isPalindrome(121)) => true
//console.log(isPalindrome(23)) => false


//if then previous one was to easy for you, pleas implement a method, that returns the prime numbers between 2 and 100. If the current number is a palindrome too, than return 'Zeno' instead of the number.
//feel free to use, the previous written pythn algorithm
//test method is missing on purpose.



//Good Luck! :)
